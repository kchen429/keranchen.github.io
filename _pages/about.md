I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Professor Kirthevasan Kandasamy](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/index.html). Prior to coming to Madison, I received Bachelor of Science in Statistics from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/). I am interested in the fields of machine learning, game theory, and mechanism design. Beyond my research, I have a keen interest in photography and violin.
